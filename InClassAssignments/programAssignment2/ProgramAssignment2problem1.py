# (35 points) Write a Python program using file operation. You will open an input file
# “students.dat” that will contain a list of student names, classification, and grade in the
# class. (All student info is completely made up) You should read through the entire input
# file. After reading in all information, do operations (No built-in functions like Average,
# min, max, count, etc.), close the input file and write that following information with
# labels to an output file “student_statistics.txt”
